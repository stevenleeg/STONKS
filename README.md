# STONKS!
I have your best interests in mind. Currently only for MacOS.

## Installation
Clone the repository anywhere onto your computer, cd to the directory, and run:
```
$ python ./install.py
```

This will create a directory in `~/.stonks` which contains the python script
and a customized `launchctl` configuration (which manages the background
process on MacOS).

If you're sick of it, just run `python ./uninstall.py` which will delete
everything, including the background task.
